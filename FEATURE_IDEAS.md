This file contains a list of potential new features that could be added to the application to enhance its intelligence, workflow, and user experience.

### Category 1: Intelligence & Analysis

1.  **Dynamic CV Tailoring:**
    *   **What it is:** Instead of matching against a single static `cv.txt`, create a feature that generates a *tailored CV* for a specific, high-match job. It would analyze the job description and slightly rephrase or reorder the points in your base CV to emphasize the skills the employer is looking for.
    *   **Why it's useful:** This is extremely powerful for getting through Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). You could have a "Download Tailored CV" button for each opportunity, giving you the perfect document to upload.

2.  **"Market-Fit" Analysis Page:**
    *   **What it is:** A new dashboard page that analyzes all the job descriptions you've saved in your database. It would identify the most frequently mentioned skills, technologies, and qualifications.
    *   **Why it's useful:** It answers the question, "What is the market *actually* looking for right now?" It could show you that, for instance, "TypeScript" appeared in 70% of saved jobs, while "Vue" only appeared in 10%. This helps you understand where to focus your learning and how to position yourself.

### Category 2: Workflow & Automation

3.  **Proactive Notifications:**
    *   **What it is:** When the proactive hunter finds a very high-match opportunity (e.g., score > 0.8), it could send you a notification via email or another service.
    *   **Why it's useful:** You wouldn't have to constantly check the dashboard. The app would tell you when something truly exciting has been found, allowing you to act on it immediately.

4.  **Automated Follow-Up Reminders:**
    *   **What it is:** If an application has been in the "applied" status for a set amount of time (e.g., 7 days), the system could automatically create a task or a reminder for you to send a follow-up email.
    *   **Why it's useful:** It helps you stay on top of your applications and shows continued interest to employers, which can make a real difference.

### Category 3: Dashboard & UI Enhancements

5.  **Interview Calendar:**
    *   **What it is:** A new page or a component on the "Interviews" page that displays all your scheduled interviews on a calendar.
    *   **Why it's useful:** It provides a clear, visual way to manage your interview schedule, which can get hectic quickly.

6.  **Enhanced Analytics & Trends:**
    *   **What it is:** You could expand the "Stats" page to show more trends over time. For example:
        *   What is the average time from "applied" to "interview"?
        *   Which `stack_keywords` are leading to the highest-scoring matches?
        *   A funnel chart showing the drop-off from "opportunity" -> "applied" -> "interview".
    *   **Why it's useful:** It helps you understand what's working and what's not in your job search strategy, allowing you to adapt and improve.
