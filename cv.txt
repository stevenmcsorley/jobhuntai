Kura, Glasgow
Front-End Developer
2016 – Jul 2017
Designed and built a custom installable web app for a new call center operating under strict security audits, which required compatibility with Internet Explorer 10. To work around browser limitations, created a lightweight Windows .msi installer that launched a headless Chrome instance, wrapping the app as a desktop-like experience.

The app collected structured answers from call assistants, helping analysts identify the main reasons behind customer calls. Originally a side project, the tool saved the company over £25K annually by enabling smarter customer support strategies. Hosted internally, the app allowed instant updates — from modifying question sets to updating themes. A custom-built SQL dashboard let analysts filter, chart, and export data to Excel independently. Seasonal themes (e.g., Halloween, Christmas) were also added to reduce visual fatigue for daily users.

Caliber, Edinburgh
Front-End Developer
Jun 2015 – Dec 2015
Developed commercial features using JQuery, PHP, and SCSS. Partnered with designers to rapidly prototype and refine web interfaces across multiple client campaigns.
