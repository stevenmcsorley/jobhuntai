# Database Backup Summary

**Created:** August 21, 2025, 19:07 UTC
**Purpose:** Pre-multi-user conversion backup

## Backup Files Created

1. **`jobhunt_backup_20250821_200536.db`** - Complete SQLite database file (241KB)
2. **`schema_2025-08-21T19-07-23.sql`** - Full database schema (4.4KB)
3. **`data_sample_2025-08-21T19-07-23.txt`** - Sample data from all tables (62KB)

## Current Database Structure

### Core Job Management Tables
- **`jobs`** - Job listings with descriptions, company info, etc.
- **`applications`** - Application tracking with status
- **`matches`** - CV matching results with scores and insights
- **`interviews`** - Interview scheduling and management

### User Profile & CV Tables  
- **`profiles`** - Master profile information
- **`cvs`** - CV content storage (currently single user with user_id=1)
- **`skills`** - Skill definitions
- **`work_experiences`** + **`experience_highlights`** - Work history
- **`projects`** + **`project_highlights`** - Project portfolio
- **`education`** - Educational background

### Testing & Learning Tables
- **`test_sessions`** - Test attempts with scores
- **`test_results`** - Individual question results
- **`guidance`** - AI-generated learning guidance

### Configuration Tables
- **`preferences`** - User preferences and settings
- **`application_notes`** - Notes on job applications

## Current Single-User Elements

The following tables/fields assume a single user:
- `cvs.user_id` defaults to 1
- `matcher.js` hardcoded to user_id: 1
- All data is globally accessible (no user isolation)

## Data Volume (Current State)
- **Jobs:** ~100+ entries with full descriptions
- **Applications:** Multiple status types (applied, opportunity, followup, etc.)
- **Test Sessions:** Historical test data with scores
- **Profile Data:** Complete master profile setup
- **Preferences:** Configured job search preferences

## Multi-User Conversion Plan

To convert to multi-user, we need to:
1. Add `users` table for authentication
2. Add `user_id` foreign keys to all user-specific tables
3. Update all API endpoints to filter by authenticated user
4. Add authentication middleware and frontend login system
5. Migrate existing data to be owned by "user 1"

## Restoration Instructions

To restore from backup:
```bash
# Stop the application
# Replace the database file
cp backups/jobhunt_backup_20250821_200536.db jobhunt.db

# Or restore schema only (empty database)
# Use the schema_2025-08-21T19-07-23.sql file to recreate structure
```

## Notes
- This backup represents a fully functional single-user job hunting application
- All interview management, CV matching, test hub, and profile features are working
- Data includes real job descriptions, test results, and user preferences
- Ready for multi-user conversion while preserving existing functionality
