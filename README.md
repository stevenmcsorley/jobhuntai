# Job Hunt AI

This project is a comprehensive, AI-powered job hunting assistant designed to automate the entire lifecycle of a job search, from discovery and preparation to application. It features a modular Node.js backend, a powerful and responsive React dashboard, and a suite of generative AI features powered by Groq.

For a detailed breakdown of the components, see the [**Project Overview**](OVERVIEW.md).

## Core Features

### Automation & AI
*   **Multi-Source Scraping**: Scrapes job listings from multiple sources, including **CWJobs**, **LinkedIn**, and **Indeed.com**.
*   **AI-Powered Analysis**: Leverages the Groq AI API to:
    *   Perform a **CV match** against job descriptions.
    *   Generate **interview preparation notes**.
    *   Draft a tailored **cover letter**.
    *   Generate a **summary of a company's market position** and products.
    *   Extract **technical skills** from a job description.
*   **Proactive Job Hunter**: A background agent that periodically searches for high-match jobs.

### Interactive React Dashboard
A modern, responsive web interface for controlling and monitoring the application.
*   **Modern UI**:
    *   Built with **Tailwind CSS** for a clean, consistent, and modern design.
    *   A **collapsible sidebar** with icons for a minimalist view.
    *   **Responsive tables** with a **minimalist stats bar** in the header.
    *   A clean **kebab menu** for all table actions.
*   **Data Management**:
    *   Trigger scrapes, view, filter, and search all jobs.
    *   **Flexible Workflow**: Move any job to an **"Opportunity"** status at any time.
    *   Update application statuses and **delete** jobs.
*   **Bulk Import**:
    *   A dedicated page to **bulk add jobs** by pasting a JSON array.
*   **Deep Analysis Page**:
    *   A dedicated page to view and **edit job descriptions**.
    *   Generate CV matches, interview prep, cover letters, and company info on demand.
    *   Extract, view, and manage **technical skills** from the job description.
*   **AI-Powered Test & Guidance Hubs**:
    *   **Test Hub**: Take AI-generated tests on technical topics or practice behavioral interviews with the **STAR** and **SOAR** methods. After each test, you can **retake only the questions you answered incorrectly**.
    *   **Guidance Hub**: Get a personalized learning plan generated by an AI tutor that analyzes your test history to find your weakest areas.
*   **Market Fit Analysis**:
    *   A dedicated page that analyzes all the jobs in your database to identify the most in-demand skills.

### Technical Foundation
*   **Persistent Database**: All data is stored in a local SQLite database, managed by Knex.js migrations.
*   **External Configuration**: Job search URLs are managed in a simple `config.json` file.
